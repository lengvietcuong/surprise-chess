Surprise Chess is a special variant of chess that incorporates random effects or 'surprises' that make the game intense and unpredictable. These include:

- **Shuffled** starting position (similar to Chess960)
- **Paralysis**: a piece may be unable to move
- **Shield**: a piece may receive protection against captures
- **Morphing**: a piece may turn into a different piece
- **Invisibility**: the opponent's pieces may become invisible

Available game modes:

- Player vs Bot
